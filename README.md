### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.


I did this challenge to broaden my knowledge and practice my skills in CSS. Doing this challenge teached me a lot on how to use CSS properties, for example, `display` such as `display:block` and `display:none` for mobile responsiveness instead of always using `display:flex`. 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

 - I learned how to use make a website responsive. 

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('🎉')
}
```


### Continued development

After this challenge, I realized how I have a lot to learn in Front-End and on how to build a mobile responsive website.
